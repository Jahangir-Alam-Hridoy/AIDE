# AndroidIDE - Android App Development on Android Phone 📱

AIDE lets you **create and build Android apps directly on your Android phone**, without Android Studio or a computer.  
It includes **Python-based tools** and utilities to generate projects, manage imports, and simplify the development process.

## ✨ Features
- 📦 **Project Generator**
  - Generate a new Android project by simply providing:
    - **Package Name**
    - **App Name**
  - Automatically generates the required file structure.
  - Supports creating **Jetpack Compose apps**.

- 🛠 **Auto Import Manager** (`checkimport.py`)
  - Analyzes your Kotlin files and automatically adds required imports.  
  - Saves time by fixing missing imports for **Jetpack Compose**.

- 🌐 **Web-based Control Panel** (`aide.py`)
  - A Flask-based web interface to:
